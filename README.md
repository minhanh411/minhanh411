- 👋 Hi, I’m @minhanh411 (you can call me Minh)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code. I am a newbie in the tech world so I decided to start learning web development first. Then, I can move on to learn about backend. I know that's a lot to do but the idea of building something on my own intrigued me :) I started with HTML, CSS and Javascript but will move on to React, NodeJS, and Python in the later stages. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javacript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for beginners, where I can contribute and practice at the same time. I am looking for more learning opportunities but at the same time would like to show you my enthusiasm and eagerness. 
- 📫 How to reach me: please email me at minhanh411@gmail.com
